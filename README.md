# Openlane FYI

A short, single page site to give some basic information to potential customers, investors, or interested community.

## Project Structure

This site uses [Astro](https://astro.build/) which uses the following structure:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## Getting Started

To get the project setup, you must copy the config example into the root of your directory. All `.env` files are ignored by .gitignore so you do not have to worry about accidentally committing secrets.

```
cp config/.env.example .env
```

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
